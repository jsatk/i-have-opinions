# Jesse's Very Biased Intro To Metal(ish) Music

Some disclaimers and info about how this document.

* A friend asked me for some metal music to run to.  So that's why there's references to running throughout.  I thought them amusing enough to leave in.  I had lot fun making this and thought it served as a descent starting point and likely a thing I'd want to reference again so here it stands.
* This is very biased towards what I like.  This is meant to answer the question that is sometimes asked to me of "Jesse, how do I get into metal?" or "What metal albums do you recommend?" or "I like ____.  Do you have any recommendations?  Before yelling at me on Twitter or opening an issue about how I didn't include _your_ favorite album consider that this is a very personalized recommendation on how to get into a genre of music that is often quite abrasive and difficult for many.
* Every album below is an album that I, at the very least, like.  Many of these I love.  I've noted in the few areas where I've put something on here that I do not like specifically with the intention of saying "This isn't for me but it might be for you."
* Genres are meant to be a guide, a descriptor.  We have them so that we have some common language to describe music.  Metal in particular can get comically nuanced with its subgenres.  The following headings should be taken with an extreme grain of salt.  And if you strongly feel I've mislabeled something and want to scream at me about it please scream inside your heart.
<!-- * Albums with a ★ next to them are albums that are in my personal top tier list (this does not indicate that they have to be in yours). -->
* All links are to the albums on Spotify.  However I highly encourage you to support these artists financially if you do end up digging on them.
* This is in no way the complete end all be all list.  This is _my_ list.

## Black Metal & Black Metal Adjacent Stuff Such As "Black Gaze" & Black 'N' Roll"

Alcest — [Kodama](https://open.spotify.com/album/7cf5MM7qQ6V0Petqr4aeZ2?si=36d8f0e4c7d04ebd)

> FRANCE — French black metal about Miyazaki's _Princess Mononoke_ which happens to be my favorite film of his.  It rules.  It's a great example of the "blackgaze" genre.

Deafheaven — [Sunbather](https://open.spotify.com/album/2kKXGWaCEl06EKZ4DxBJIT?si=Z1P3wmrWSGG75hhavFcMaQ)  
Deafheaven — [New Bermuda](https://open.spotify.com/album/2e4xOasRFhJn4x2MBM5pdu?si=9aZhawP9Sfy8OGiim50h8A)  
Deafheaven — [Ordinary Corrupt Human Love](https://open.spotify.com/album/2iA7rzpQsOfAPkfH4Ekp7f?si=fd2WHkEPQPOOzIv9rcO1iQ)

> OAKLAND, CA — They made black metal + shoegaze (blackgaze) mainstream(ish).  These guys are phenomenal and I adore them.  They're extremely divisive.

Holy Fawn — [Death Spells](https://open.spotify.com/album/3L9kfqui54S1V2MvOHKmJC?si=ZGr-ozu7Qbuw_nHtwSaYcA)

> TEMPE, AZ — _Barely_ meets the criteria for "blackgaze" but I love this record.  If you're wall-of-sound curious but not sure you dig on angry screaming this is a great start.

Glassing — [Twin Dream](https://open.spotify.com/album/4r6YcYB5Zgv0TcKQpsEcje?si=c54d749780bd46e3)

> AUSTIN, TX — Like if Holy Fawn actually did Black Metal.

Wolves in the Throne Room — [Celestian Lineage](https://open.spotify.com/album/3LHSxySCaooKrQxuLtuYSV?si=1gEIMAkVRIak9pD5uzDDTQ)

> OLYMPIA, WA — Black metal from dudes who live in the Pacific Northwest.  They play with like moss and shit on their amps.  It sounds like if a druid made black metal.

Myrkur — [M](https://open.spotify.com/album/6rJfbMmi86eK8MSXNBUW9s?si=XaubZ25PQluVekxwMZqjTg)
Myrkur — [Mareridt](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ewAlccDDYFoybQaMnkTvW?si=sDoiCSP8RgG_iYUXtBpuMw)

> COPENHAGEN, DENMARK — Amalie Bruun is a danish lady who makes the coolest Scandinavian black metal.  Her, along with Deafheaven, got me into this genre in a big way in the mid-2010s.

Panopticon — [...And Again Into The Light](https://open.spotify.com/album/6rJfbMmi86eK8MSXNBUW9s?si=XaubZ25PQluVekxwMZqjTg)

> LOUISVILLE, KY — Austin Lunn is a guy from Kentucky who makes black metal about nature and miners and labor unions.  All of his albums are of almost equal quality so I simply put his latest on here.  If you like the softer more uhhh nature-y bits, check out his album "The Scars of Man on the Once Nameless Wilderness".  If you dig the hints of bluegrass check out "Kentucky".

Kvelertak — [Meir](https://open.spotify.com/album/5PAjZGAD8j0XZANLxJWulb?si=HxRo8uEhTICOMKrHCRQCrg)

> NORWAY — This is the definition of "black 'n' roll".  If black metal shotgunned a few beers and wanted to party this is what it'd sound like.  I have no idea what he's saying and I love this album so much.  Instantly puts me in a good mood.

Bathroy — [Blood Fire Death](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Fs15tQVmd94pSRIpfd73N?si=f9I4ofT-Q7WLDKZAgyHpWQ)

> SWEDEN — I know what you're thinking.  "Where the hell is Sweden?  Finland?  Norway!?"  Well here it is.  Of all the classic "Oh my god you have to listen to this historic and important record!" from Scandinavia this is my favorite (sorry Darkthrone & Mayhem you guys aren't that good actually).  This album's recording quality is meh, but literally every black metal album from this era is.  But this is a metal classic for a reason.  Pretty sure this is considered black metal, but it doesn't sound like modern black metal.

## Blacken Death Metal (yes this is a real sub genre)

Behemoth — [The Satanist](https://open.spotify.com/album/7l0L2YHlQwAyI4QyZTIWGS?si=sWCj7s4BSpGgtezue8tkDg)

> POLAND — They invented this ridiculously named sub sub genre.  They're extremely anti-religion.  Their lead singer Nergal has gotten in trouble in their home of Poland for violating various blasphemy laws that are still on the books.  They are one of the most intense and most popular extreme metal acts around.  So popular in fact that their lead singer Nergal was on Poland's version of "The Voice" tv show.  No I'm not kidding.  They rule so hard.  This album sounds like the book of Revelations.

## Death Metal

(Note: I do not like the vast majority of death metal.  Here's the little I like.)

Blood Incantation — [Hidden History of the Human Race](https://open.spotify.com/album/34U0n1oAE5mwgdaIBrcIck?si=U84140nFS_W1t2eFL6aZIQ)

> DENVER, CO — I think it's about aliens or something.  It rules.

Rivers of Nihil — [Where Owls Know My Name](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Ue1iqByWrHTVFUkTpnm7D?si=uG61nehpQ52LMJDMyJyrAw)

> READING, PA — It has saxophone and works way better than it has any right to.  Also one of the few death metal bands where I can largely understand what he's saying.

Crypta — [Echoes of the Soul](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Qn60MSSzOZ3JJuKuy9JLc?si=Z7AkQsJKQW2skJ8y5qlDBg)

> BRAZIL — All-women death metal from a place where you wouldn't expect death metal from (I only call out both facts as they are, simply put, a rarity in this genre).  They have one record that came out during the pandemic and I got obsessed with it.

## Modern "Normal" Metal Fare

Baroness — [The Red Album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7HjDc1R38sIpwbKHOrbBNR?si=CdtENdCkQTq9LIxyOITfCg)

> SAVANNAH, GA — Look.  I wanna put all their albums on here but that'd be silly.  This is their first and still their best.  If you dig it keep going. You can't go wrong. A good second album of theirs is "Yellow" but it's all similar vein.  (Yes all their albums are named after colors.  No I don't know what that's about.  Also the lead singer John Baizely does all their album art and did the album art for the aformentioned Kvelertak's record "Meir".)  Seriously just turn on the song "Isak" very loud.

High on Fire — [Electric Wizard](https://open.spotify.com/album/5i6i0qVIkSwQ648B7FNFAa?si=Z8RBtwgMS127jw5yViLGLw)

> OAKLAND, CA — This album goes so hard.  Just...  Oh my god.  It rules.  Matt Pike from the band Sleep front's this band and his voice is scary and his guitar tone is even scarier.  I'm pretty sure he plugs his guitar into the molten core of the earth.

Mastodon — [Blood Mountain](https://open.spotify.com/album/1n8QZFcwx5aQ2LIIlj0iYe?si=0b3XzWyuTWGiidO7mBGuIA)
Mastodon — [Leviathan](https://open.spotify.com/album/6khFoLWnJZDQvZ7Pijym3b?si=fOO3uQSRSAaW40Rf_zEctQ)

> ATLANTA, GA — The gold standard of modern American heavy metal.  "Leviathan" is about Moby Dick.  It's fun.  I like all their stuff, but these two are still the best of the crop.  They are probably the most "mainstream" metal band in the world right now that's not from the 80s.

Gojira — [L'Enfant Sauvage](https://open.spotify.com/album/2WrU1VLLBaZy4k5s0p5jzt?si=wLqIaci4RKGkBG5VrlHrTg)

> FRANCE — If you couldn't tell from the title of the record, these guys are french.  This record is considered a modern classic.  I dig it.  I don't dig it as much as some people think I should.  But nonetheless.  If you dig this try their latest "Born For One Thing" which is my second favorite of theirs.

## Older "Normal" Metal Fare

Bold Thrower — [The IVth Crusade](https://open.spotify.com/album/5KGfoKn51bVXAauPmV47K3?si=uUluv8NZSfqmbAkLiKoKIQ)

> ENGLAND — Literally an album by a bunch of nerds who wanted to write songs about Warhammer (I think).  This is way more fun than it has any right to be.  Also I am pretty sure at the time they were classified as death metal or grindcore.  But to modern ears it fits nice and comfortably in the "fun cheezy metal from the 90s" bucket.

Iron Maiden — [The Number of the Beast](https://open.spotify.com/album/33d72N71hl9bXwT4zAcqUy?si=JB5EsGP2QgqBC1ts0vNJIA)

> ENGLAND — My favorite old school metal band, and it's not even close.  Start with this record.  If you dig this go forward or backwards any direction in their catalog.  Keep going until you don't like it anymore.  They had a run of some really amazing albums until the 90s where they got not as good.  Just one of the most fun bands to ever do it.

## Thrash

(Note: I do not like thrash.  I've tried... so much...)

Metallica — [Master of Puppets](https://open.spotify.com/album/7CGhx630DIjdJqaBDVKc5j?si=A81jkjosQimbyYSzSmyHKw)

> OAKLAND, CA — Look.  It's "Master of Puppets".  I guess this is the best thrash record?  I still don't dig it.  Maybe you will.

## Slow Trudgy Doom Stuff That Has A Foot In Dad Rock And You Will Grow A Beard If You Listen To It Too Much

Black Sabbath — [Paranoid](https://open.spotify.com/album/6r7LZXAVueS5DqdrvXJJK7?si=Xp3rK5hsSAeroMNej56KIQ)
Black Sabbath — [Master of Reality](https://open.spotify.com/album/7pGb2cOGVz6vLyaZaKOQ7D?si=RuMhcQS1SoGJ0MV-pu20ZA)

> ENGLAND — I mean... These records aren't classic in a "ya gotta do your homework sense".  These records are legitimately incredible and fun.  And hilariously, there's a lot of pro-christian themes despite all the hand-wringing from the church when they came out.

Pallbearer — [Foundations of Burden](https://open.spotify.com/album/5hcHyM3KYY97gUZzfRlNZb?si=QGYfAsLSREauXd3Gk81flw)

> LITTLE ROCK, AK — Heavy dad rock from the land of Clinton.

Paradise Lost — [Obsidian](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ameBtOmrJFgiNXx8W7OLx?si=VIeGrErZRuerJD5j7C2L7A)

> ENGLAND — Also heavy dad rock, but from the other side of the pond.

Sleep — Dopesmoker

> SAN JOSE, CA — These guys are from San Jose?  What?!  Okay.  Wow.  Anyways.  This record isn't on streaming right now which is sad.  This band rules.  Matt Pike from High on Fire plays guitar in it.  It's extremely slow doom metal AKA "stoner metal".  Since "Dopesmoker" isn't on streaming try literally any of their other records.

YOB — [Our Raw Heart](https://open.spotify.com/album/41cwi0xvLmVuVUtJDU8GcS?si=vWr6N5QVQdO4sQ0SM3b5-w)

> EUGENE, OR — These guys _sound_ like a beard.

## Just Rad Power Pop Metal

Dio — [Holy Diver](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ivNJLSx8Rbvnsvcn01Yt3?si=-hIQR-u9QjCRKoDOE7QUMw)

> CORTLAND, NY — Oh my god!  Friggin' Dio!  I love this record so much.  If you can listen to this record and not smile you're dead inside.

Ghost — [Ceremony And Devotion](https://open.spotify.com/album/5CueCHft20n8lr7OqwoUwM?si=KXTIXkUsTn-sx_taZ3_XIA)

> SWEDEN — This is essentially a greatest hits for the first 3 albums.  This will help you figure out quickly if the glam satanic shtick is your thing.  They are comically satanic.  They're playing on the whole satanic panic of the 80s and I love it.  It's music made to give Pat Robertson a heart attack.  If you dig them then try their newest.  If  you hate it... I get it.

## Hardcore/Metalcore Stuff That's Not Technically "Metal" But Is Adjacent And May Have A Toe In Screamo Or Emo

Converge — [Jane Doe](https://open.spotify.com/album/2gtM4m6sglJDrX3toJWZO6?si=oPJ6ZsWmR3esp_VO7LqlFg)
Converge — [You Fail Me](https://open.spotify.com/album/4nVzGj56uXP3bXu4rcH5Ob?si=JNoFtJ2WRZWYEZfbbSaLwQ)
Converge — [The Dusk In Us](https://open.spotify.com/album/23cl7dningjCbwiNpOyFMP?si=mO00i2M3TI-J_zuRgjm8Hw)

> SALEM, MA — I'm a Converge super fan.  Literally any album from "Jane Doe" on gets my full endorsement (I like the first two but they're harder to recommend).  Start with "You Fail Me" prolly if you've never listened.  Also they have a new album with Chelsea Wolfe (that I mention below that and also Chelsea Wolfe duets on a track on Myrkur's second record) is good.

Every Time I Die — [Low Teens](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YIQv7ZD6WRY2NM88FBucx?si=2PZRJnm3QLy0c4N6NqZLxg)

> BUFFALO, NY — Party-core but also they sometimes sing about racist cops being bad and depression.  I love this band.  If you dig this record bounce over to literally any other one of theirs.  The song "We'rewolf" is probably their biggest hit and got some radio play.

Oathbreaker — [Rheia](https://open.spotify.com/album/6UUIocFoD9p2aOO5jvD9zt?si=3mfc-DaZQQ20Etmw-PG6BA)

> BELGIUM — Female-fronted black-ish metalcore that dips its toe into wall of sound stuff.

Chalk Hands — [Don't Think About Death](https://open.spotify.com/album/2eNEFVJxXfpz11dKORYYOy?si=LAVaekATQ56qkse_fL0_EQ)

> ENGLAND — Brand new and very traditional screamo.  Less Underoath and more American Football & Braid with screaming.  I am really digging on this record right now.

Underoath — [They're Only Chasing Safety](https://open.spotify.com/album/5GeXnKDk6sD6RnkPVwFi19?si=h7Xfw-43QOOTvD8v1RznfA)

> TAMPA, FL — I mean. C'mon. It's a classic screamo record.  Does it show some age?  Sure.  But what on here doesn't.  This is fun and has solid pop hooks in between the screaming.

United Nations — [The Next Four Years](https://open.spotify.com/album/4eYvhp2VAf6fvQoEuqPJBr?si=T0lT3JhnQPqYPFMmTXDAow)

> NYC, NY — Very intense screamo super group.  Geoff Rickley from Thursday does the vocals.  There's guys from Glassjaw, Converge, and The Number 12 Looks LIke You in this group.  It's short and will make your head explode.  I really don't get why this record is so slept on.  They don't care for the republican party much.

## I Have No Idea What To Call This... Goth... I Guess?

Chelsea Wolfe — [Hiss Spun](https://open.spotify.com/album/1nnenAgIzIipcodyg879Vx?si=i7racGMkQUGfEu98FDuhYw)

> ROSEVILLE, CA — Sounds like the girl from the well in _The Ring_ made a record.  That's a compliment.

Lingua Ignota — [Sinner Get Ready](https://open.spotify.com/album/06wtf2TCkmyTgS1yZGiSr5?si=sePdfMSsTIOx5eGQQebfYQ)

> DEL MAR, CA — An exvangelical like myself.  Classically trained.  This is not metal in any way, except when it's totally metal.  It is extremely goth.  And will mess you up if you listen to the lyrics too closely.  I can truly say I've never heard a record quite like this.
